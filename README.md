# Traffic_Sign_Classification
Classification of 32 traffic sign using Keras library and Tensorflow platform

## Description
In this project, the goal is to create a deep learning model to recognize traffic signs. In this project, the deep learning model was built that by training model using German traffic sign images and then classify the unlabeled traffic signs. The deep learning model will be built using tensorflow and we will also understand various ways to preprocess images using OpenCV and also use a cloud GPU service provider.

## Datasets
The Dataset which used in this project is the German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. The datasets can be found and downloaded from this [link](https://bitbucket.org/jadslim/german-traffic-signs).
